    The calculations and mathematics behind the list points on the Challenge List, a form of incentive that exists for challenge players to complete challenges.
  <hr />
</div>

Welcome to the repository containing all the mathematical calculations that go into the Challenge List's points algorithm. It is open source so that anyone can freely contribute or make changes or proposals to the algorithm, as well as giving everyone a sense of transparency and trust in the algorithm and how it works. Otherwise, there is no other fundamental usage of this repository outside of transparency.

## Requirements
* Rust (version unknwown, but latest nightly is recommended)

## Contributions
All contributions that make changes to how points are calculated are welcome, but must be done in proposals. This repository is made for the standardisation of the algorithm, and any changes to it must be done in a proposal. This is to ensure that the algorithm is not changed without the list point team's consent. Once a proposal has been made, it will be deliberated on by the list point standardization committee on the issue, and anyone relevant who wishes to discuss it there, and if it is accepted, then it will go into deliberation by Challenge List moderators and staff alike internally. If it is accepted, then it will be implemented into the algorithm and merged into the master branch.

If you wish to make a proposal, please make a pull request with the changes you wish to make, as well as a form of consistent document detailing the statistics and data backing it. This is to ensure that the proposal is not just a random change, but is backed by data and statistics consistent with good mathematical reasoning.
